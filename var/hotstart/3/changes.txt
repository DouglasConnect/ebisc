Added a field 'biosample_id' storing cell line biosample identifier, and then removed the biosample_id from the list of alternate names if it was there already.

Added a field 'donor_biosample_id' storing donor biosample identifier

Changed the field 'internal_donor_id' to be an array of strings, not a single string. This allows adding multiple donor aliases where Roslin had a different name from hESCreg.

Added a field 'disease_purl' e.g. http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0002508.
Curated ontology terms to be more appropriate for these cell lines
Filled in 'disease_flag' and set it to zero where it was missing (control lines)
Filled in 'disease_control_cellline_phenotype' where we had information from Roslin about control lines.

Added a field 'primary_celltype_purl' e.g. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_000036
Filled in 'primary_celltype_ont_id' and other disease information where it was missing. But note: the IMS should store the full primary_celltype_purl.
Corrected some primary cell types, in correspondence with Roslin and generator institutes

Set 'teratoma_formation_differentiation_flag' to 1 where we know it has been done

Deleted some errant characters from strings e.g. '\t\t'
