These files started life as an export from hESCreg on 20150409

strict_json: this directory contains the curated json which should be loaded
into IMS.

annotated_json: These files contain comments starting with a '#' so they are
not valid json. But they are in a human-readable format and they are here to be
helpful. In terms of data content they are identical to the strict_json files
