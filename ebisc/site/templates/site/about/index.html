<h1>About EBiSC</h1>

<div class="lead">EBiSC is a large European public-private partnership project supported jointly by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and members of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which aims at establishing the first European Bank for induced pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC).</div>

<div class="main">

<p>EBiSC is designed to address the increasing demand for quality-controlled, disease-relevant research-grade iPSC lines, data and cell services.</p>

<p>EBiSC will demonstrate after 3 years an operational responsible banking and distribution service of iPSC lines by building a robust, reliable supply chain from the generation of cell lines, over the specification, to internationally accepted quality criteria and their world-wide distribution to any qualified user.</p>

<p>EBiSC will subsequently establish for Europe a centralised, not-for-profit bank providing researchers across academia and industry with access to scalable, cost-efficient and consistent, high quality tools for new medicines development.</p>

<p>EBiSC is coordinated by Pfizer Ltd and managed by Roslin Cells Ltd. and includes private corporations such as pharmaceutical companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and non-profit organisations, as well as academic, charitable and public institutions.

<h2>The EBiSC Cell Line Catalogue</h2>

<p>During the “Hot Start” phase up to 64 iPS cell lines representing both disease backgrounds and normal controls will enter the EBiSC Foundational Collection. These iPS cell lines which are being expanded by the eight iPSC Centres have already been well characterised and are in most cases published.</p>

<p>In addition to the Hot Start phase, hundreds of lines from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute’s HipSci project will join the collection as will lines generated by academic laboratories from all around the world.</p>

<h2>Consortium Partners</h2>

<p>The EBiSC Consortium represents all relevant stakeholders from tissue donors to clinical and academic iPSC researchers and industrial users and thus provides the scientific expertise, facilities, networks and experience to achieve the project goals and respond appropriately to advances in science and society.</p>

<p>Led by Pfizer Ltd and managed by Roslin Cells, the Consortium comprises 8 active participant iPSC Centres with clinical and patient networks, a global leader in industrial iPSC supply, international experts in iPSC science, biobanking, bioengineering, regenerative medicine and data management, and scholars in law and ethics.</p>
